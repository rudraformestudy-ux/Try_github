# Copilot Instructions for Try_github

## Project Overview
This is a testing and learning repository designed to explore Jupyter notebooks, Python fundamentals, and Git workflows. The project contains simple Python scripts and notebook experiments for educational purposes.

## Codebase Structure
- **try.ipynb** - Primary notebook with basic Python examples (print statements, loops)
- **try_2.ipynb** - Secondary notebook with iterative loop examples
- **hello world.txt** - Documentation notes about the project's learning goals and Git workflow exploration
- **README.md** - Project description

## Project Type & Environment
- **Type**: Jupyter Notebook learning project
- **Language**: Python (no version constraints noted)
- **No external dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Notebook Structure
- Notebooks serve as executable learning documents
- Cells contain standalone Python examples (printing, loops, control flow)
- Empty cells are used as placeholders for future code exploration

### Development Workflow
- Changes are tested by executing notebook cells
- Git is used to track changes and verify they appear on GitHub
- The goal is to understand how changes propagate from local edits → execution → GitHub visibility

## When Working on This Codebase

1. **Adding examples**: Create new cells in existing notebooks rather than new files
2. **Testing changes**: Use the notebook cell execution interface to verify code works
3. **Git integration**: The repository tracks how notebooks and text files synchronize with GitHub
4. **Python code style**: Keep examples simple and pedagogically clear (as seen in `try.ipynb` and `try_2.ipynb`)

## Common Tasks
- **Adding Python examples**: Edit notebook cells directly with new code and execute to verify
- **Documenting learning**: Update `hello world.txt` or create notebook markdown cells for explanations
- **Git workflow practice**: Commit changes and push to verify GitHub integration

## No Special Dependencies or Configurations
This is a minimal project—no build process, no testing framework, and no configuration files required. Focus on the learning experience rather than complex tooling.
